# How was my stock trading behaviour and results?

## This data tracks my behavior while stock trading and the corresponding results.

I evaluate my decisions based on the price difference from the past month, **my instincts**, and my **actions**.

1. If a trade yields a profit or avoids a loss, it is considered a ***good*** decision.

2. If it results in a loss, it is deemed a ***bad*** decision.
